  <!-- EN: A large pair of retro sunglasses, a callback to the late 20th century. This pair of shades contain a hidden utility however, as they are fitted with a T.R.I.S. (short for Targeting and Reloading Intelligence System) subpersona AI. This AI's sole directive is to inform its wearer of hostile targets and moments of opportunity as quickly as possible. This emphasis on swift action puts a subtle but effective psychological pressure on the wearer to aim and reload as fast as humanly possible, at the cost of slightly reduced accuracy.\n        \nThese glasses also have a PLATE class shield generator built in that fully envelops the wearer's head. It acts similarly to standard armor, as while it does not provide perfect protection, it will never break from heat buildup, nor does it get in the way of projectile weaponry. The shield is also invisible, because having a giant bubble around the user's head would be a crime against fashion. Due to the fact that these shades are explicitly designed for combat, the shield generator is strengthened at the cost of being more expensive to produce. -->
